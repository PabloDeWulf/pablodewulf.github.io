Hi, my name is Pablo and I am a student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl). At the moment i'm in my third year of engineering. This website is your window into my world of projects and other stuff I enjoy.


ut youl√ßlr address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
