In my second year of engineering at [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl) my friends and I recieved the challenge to build an autonomous stairs climbing robot.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robot1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robot2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

Here's some insight into how we handled this project. 
<div class="row">
    <div class="container" id="yt-frame">

  #yt-frame {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
  }
  #yt-frame>iframe {
    position: absolute;

This project has undoubtedly been one of the most enjoyable experiences I have undertaken thus far. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into efficient work practices and developed my collaborative abilities by working closely with fellow students. Additionally, I had the opportunity to enhance my proficiency in utilizing [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), a valuable skillset for future use.
