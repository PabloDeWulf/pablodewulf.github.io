In my second year of engineering at [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl) my friends and I recieved the challenge to build a scale cable stayed bridge and put it to the test. Here's a video summarising the whole thing:

<div class="row">

<style>
  #yt-frame {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
  }
  #yt-frame>iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>

Pretty cool design, right?

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>

This project was a great example of putting theory into practice. We paid close attention to phenomena like momentum, torsion, and buckling. We performed many tensile tests and became proficient in interpreting the data from these tests. Moreover, we learned to work with [SCIA](https://www.scia.net/en/scia-engineer?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_aemBhBLEiwAT98FMlyN-BKDVb6qJuDUp87qkCJYo3LwOrJBqqam7EE3U096LgRlOFLqVRoCzX0QAvD_BwE), a useful tool for our future projects. This one was a banger!
