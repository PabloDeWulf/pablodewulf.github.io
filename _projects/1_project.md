In my second year of engineering at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl) my friends and I received the challenge to build an autonomous stair-climbing robot. 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robot1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robot2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/robot3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>
I put together a youtube video explaining the whole thing: 
<div class="row">
    <div class="container" id="yt-frame">
  <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLEpXuifAUI" title="YouTube video player" align="middle" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen id="test"></iframe>
</div>
<style>
  #yt-frame {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
  }
  #yt-frame>iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>
</div>

This project has undoubtedly been one of the most enjoyable experiences I have undertaken thus far. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into efficient work practices and developed my collaborative abilities by working closely with fellow students. Additionally, I had the opportunity to enhance my proficiency in utilising [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), a valuable skillset for future use.
