I've always wanted to make a "day in a life" video. Sooooo, I made one (it's pretty amateurish). Welcome to a realistic day in my life as a third year mechanical engineering student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl):

<div class="row">
    <div class="container" id="yt-frame">
  <iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agHC0R65lAo?si=mR8FV9I5Crw6UHop" title="YouTube video player" align="middle" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen id="test"></iframe>
</div>
<style>
  #yt-frame {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
  }
  #yt-frame>iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>

</div>

That's pretty much how an average day looks like for me (excluding the parties :D). We have a lot of courses so most of my days are pretty busy, and I like it that way. I still have enough time for training and seeing my friends, so I'm pretty happy with this balance.
