Hi, my name is Pablo and I am a student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl). I finished my Bachelors degree in Applied Sciences and Engineering. For the next 2 years, I'll be doing a double degree programme in partership with DTU in Denmark, pretty exciting stuff! Aside from the academic stuff, I love sports. I am a track and field athlete, specialised in sprint and love some good workouts. On this website I try to present certain aspects of my life and world such that people can follow the projects I am working on and see how I am doing in general.
