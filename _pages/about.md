Hi, my name is Pablo and I am a Dual-degree Electro-Mechanical Engineering student at [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl) and [Denmarkâ€™s Technical
University](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). I am currently living in Denmark, and I have to say, I've had an amazing time so far! Meeting new people, learing new things... name it. Aside from the academic stuff, I love sports. I am a track and field athlete, specialised in sprint and love some good workouts. On this website I try to present certain aspects of my life and world such that people can follow the projects I am working on and see how I am doing in general.
