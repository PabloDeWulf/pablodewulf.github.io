Hi, my name is Pablo and I am a student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl). At the moment i'm in my third year of engineering. Aside from the academic stuff, i'm also very interessted in sports. I am a track and field athlete, specialised in sprint. This platform serves as a window into my world, where you can dive into the projects I've been working on and follow my journey.
