Hi, my name is Pablo and I am a student at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl). At the moment, I'm in my third year of BSc Applied Sciences and Engineering. Next year, I'll be doing a double degree programme in partership with DTU in Copenhagen, pretty exciting stuff! Aside from  academic stuff, I love sports. I am a track and field athlete, specialised in sprint and love some good workouts. On this website I try to present certain aspects of my life and world such that people can follow the projects I am working on and see how I am doing in general.
