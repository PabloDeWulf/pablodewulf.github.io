In my second year of engineering at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/nl) my friends and I recieved the challenge to build something creative with a pingpongball, a tube and a ventilator. We came up with a soundtuner? Watch how it works, well kinda...

This project was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Initially, we faced uncertainties while working with a microcontroller and using the [MPLAB] (https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) programming environment. However, as we progressed, we grasped the basics and delved into valuable learning experiences, particularly in communication between [Python] (https://www.python.org/) and microcontrollers and utilizing Fourier transformation for sound analysis. Overall, an enriching journey.
